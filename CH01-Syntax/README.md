# Chapter 01 - Syntax of Java

Every programming language has its own syntax. This is the conventional structure which Java programmers MUST follow; by and only by doing so your Java code will be compiled and become executable.

In other words, syntax is something similar to 'grammar' in terms of human languages.

## Task
Open `Main.java file and read the code. If you get to know the syntax of Java 'barely', proceed to Chapter 2.
